## Introduction

### General knowledge

- To install macOS follow [this guide](https://khronokernel.github.io/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/) by [Mykola Grymalyuk](https://github.com/khronokernel)

- Lots of SSDT patches and how they work can be found [here](https://translate.google.it/translate?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdaliansky%2FOC-little)

- Useful tools by [Corpnewt](https://github.com/corpnewt)

- The guys from [Acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera) that make this possible

### [Why OpenCore](https://khronokernel.github.io/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/#advantages-of-opencore)

### My Hardware

- Model: Thinkpad T460s (20F9003AUS)

- Sound Card: Realtek ALC293
- Multi-touch: None
- Storage: 256GB SSD M.2 Opal2
- Optical: None
- WLAN + Bluetooth: ~~Intel 8260 ac, 2x2 + BT4.1~~ **replaced with [BCM94360CS2](/BCM94360CS2_WLAN_card.md)**
- WWAN: WWAN Upgradable (Legacy_Sierra_QMI.kext needed, not tested but should work)
- Smart Card Reader: None
- Camera: 720p
- Keyboard: Backlit
- Fingerprint Reader: Yes
- Battery: 3-cell (23Wh) + 3-cell (26Wh)

### What if I don't have this exact model?

This EFI will probably work on any T460s regardless of CPU model / RAM amount / Display resolution / Storage drive (SATA or NVMe).
- Use [EFI](/EFI) if you have a T460s

If you happen to have a similiar Thinkpad with 6th gen Skylake Intel processor (like X260, T460, T460p, T560, E560), there is a good chance that this EFI will work on it **with some precaution**:

- Use [**EFI_first_boot**](/EFI_first_boot)

1. double check your DSDT naming (like EC, LPC, KBD, etc.) with provided SSDT naming

2. change iGPU inside cofing,plist according to your model

3. follow USB ports map and CPU Power Management below


## Recomended changes

### USB ports map

To fix sleep issue I had to built a custom USBPorts.kext, SSDT-UIAC and SSDT-USBX wich maps all available ports on the T460s *except SD card reader and dock links*.
If you need a different map, e.g. to use Thinkpad dock, generate it with [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool):

```
use EFI (first boot) wich contains USBInjectAll.kext 
generate a custom USB map according to your specific needs with Hackintool
place your USBPort.kext in OC/Kexts and SSDT-UIAC & SSDT_USBX in OC/ACPI (reflect these changes in config.plist)
finally remove USBInjectAll.kext (reflect this change in config.plist)
```

### CPU Power Management

~~Two kexts are used to customize i7-6600u CPU profile:~~

```
CPUFriend.kext
CPUFriendDataProvider.kext
```

Data generated by CPUFriend are inside [SSDT-CPU](/EFI/OC/ACPI/SSDT-CPU.aml).

[CPUFriendFriend](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend) was used to set:  

```
Low Frequency Mode (LFM) = 800MHz (TDP-down frequency for i7-6600u)
Energy Performance Preference (EPP) = 80 (Balance power)
```

If you have a different CPU model, please, **~~remove these kexts~~ replace SSDT-CPU with plain [SSDT-PLUG](/EFI_first_boot/OC/ACPI/SSDT-PLUG.aml)**, power management is natevely supported by OpenCore anyway.

In the case in which you want to create your own profile, follow the guide provided for [CPUFriend](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend).

That's how power consumption looks like on idle:

### Optional

#### [Generate your own SMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
```
run the script with MacbookPro13,1
add results to PlatformInfo > Generic > MLB, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID
```

#### Enable HiDPI with [RDM Utility](https://github.com/usr-sse2/RDM/releases)
```
install RDM Utility
open it, click on "resolution", then "edit"
for 2560x1440 screens I suggest using 1440x810 resolution
to accomplish that, use the settings below
```

#### [Use PrtSc key as Screenshot shortcut](/PrtSc_key_map_to_F13.md) 
```
PrtSc is already mapped to F13 in SSDT-PS2K
```
#### Disable Wake on WiFi 
It cause transfer rate to be reduced after sleep, to fix that:  
```
SystemPreferences > Energy Saver > Power Adapter > Wake for Wi-fi network access > **Disabled**
```

#### Monitor temperatures and power consumption with [HWMonitor](https://github.com/kzlekk/HWSensors/releases)
```
I know it's old and no longer supported, but it gets the job done and i really like the simple look
```

#### Make dock animation faster and without delay
```
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.5
killall Dock
```

## What's working

>[Boot time from OC Picker to Desktop is 26s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnuQjuIrfc0)

- [x] CPU Power Management `<1W on IDLE`

- [x] All USB ports `custom USBPorts kext is used, make a new one if using dock`

- [x] Internal camera

- [x] Sleep / Wake / Shutdown / Reboot `custom USBPorts.kext required`

- [x] Ethernet

- [x] **[Wifi, Bluetooth, Airdrop, Handoff, Continuity, Sidecar wireless](/BCM94360CS2_WLAN_card.md)**

- [x] iMessage, FaceTime, App Store, iTunes Store `Generate your own SMBIOS`

- [x] Audio in/out `audio trough dock should work too thanks to AppleALC tluck's layout 28`

- [x] Battery **(very stable and precise capacity tracking)** `Thanks to EchoEsprit work for T450s`

- [x] Keyboard `volume and brighness hotkeys`

- [x] Trackpad, Trackpoint and physical buttons `two fingers swipe and tree fingers gestures`

- [x] miniDP and HDMI `video signal trough dock should work too thank to links added in DevicesProperty`

- [x] Internal camera `works without additional files`

- [x] SIP and FileVault 2 can be enabled `disabled by default in config.plist`

## What's not working

> If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me

- [ ] SD Card Reader `I will try to make it works sometime in the future`

- [ ] Fingerprint Reader `Don't think it will ever be working on macOS`
